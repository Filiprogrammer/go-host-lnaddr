# ‚ö°üñ•Ô∏èüëæ Host your own Lightning Address on LND
Lighting Wallets like [https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus](Zeus), [https://blixtwallet.github.io](Blixt) and [many more](https://github.com/andrerfneves/lightning-address/blob/master/README.md#wallets-supported) allow us to send sats to [Lighting Addresses](https://lightningaddress.com) like thats@satswellspent.com. We can hence pay without scanning the QR code of an invoice.

## Pre-requisites
- An existing Domain name and static ip address to express the lighting address(e.g. user@domain.com)
- A public Lightning Network node with sufficient inbound liquidity to receive payments to your lightning address.
- Golang [installation](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- A Webserver and reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy. (example setup instructions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-go-web-application-using-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04))
- Certbot to serve http over TLS. This is required since calls to the LNURLP are done via https. (example setup instructions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04))

## Features
- Implements the LN address protocol to receive lightning payments to an email-like address.
- Can host multiple lightning addresses on the same server instance.
- Notification support for payment receipts via email, telegram, http and more to come.
- Nostr NIP 05 style account verification, see https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md

## Notes
This stuff is experimental. I appreciate your comments and if you have questions please raise an issue.
I just recently setup my own address this way so feel free to send me some sats if you think this has been helpful to you.
